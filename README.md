# GitOpenFL
My implementation of Federated Learning for PyTorch, including various examples from different papers I read. The aim is to improve my understanding of Federated Learning, at the same time, provide an open and simple to learn implementation of the same for future reference. Everything in this repository will be implemented in PyTorch, which is something out of my comfort zone, so hopefully it goes well.
