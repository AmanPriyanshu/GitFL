# GitFL-Docs

These docs contain my personal notes as well as implementations while learning both py-torch and federated learning. While developing this library, my aim is to improve my Py-Torch skills as well as my concepts in Federated Learning outside of TensorFlow.

## [learning-py-torch](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/GitFL/tree/main/docs/learning-py-torch):

Consists of my normal implementations of the py-torch tutorial.
